# VR Stress Interview Experiment Data

## Overview
This repository contains data collected during a Virtual Reality (VR) stress interview experiment. The dataset includes physiological signals such as Electrocardiography (ECG), Photoplethysmography (PPG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and behind-the-ear Electroencephalography (EEG) data.

## Data Description
- **ECG (Electrocardiography)**: Measures the electrical activity of the heart.
- **PPG (Photoplethysmography)**: Measures blood volume changes.
- **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)**: Measures the electrical conductance of the skin, which varies with its moisture level.
- **EEG (Electroencephalography)**: Measures electrical activity in the brain, recorded from behind the ear.

## Ethical Compliance
This study and data collection were approved by Hanyang University's Institutional Bioethics Committee (IRB: HYUIRB-202201-016). According to the ethical guidelines, the data can be shared for up to three years following the conclusion of the study.

## Usage Terms

1. **Purpose**: The data should be used solely for research and educational purposes.
2. **Privacy**: Ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the participants by not attempting to re-identify them.
3. **Attribution**: Cite this dataset in any publications or presentations that result from its use.

## Code Description
This repository also includes code for processing and analyzing the data:

- **MATLAB Code**: Used to convert the data into spectrograms.
- **Python Code**: Implements deep learning training using 5-fold cross-validation.
